The aux directory contains examples of how graudit can be built upon to allow more in depth analysis.
The auxilary scripts are not part of the official release, they are included in the source package and 
package maintainers can choose to include them if they wish. These scripts will be updated adhoc for now.
If you have an auxilary script that you use or wish to improve on the existing script, please follow the
normal contribution path by forking the git repository or send me the files/patches/etc.
